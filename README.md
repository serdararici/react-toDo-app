## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks to the todo list using an input field.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Reorder Tasks**: Tasks can be reordered using the "Move Up" and "Move Down" buttons.
- **Styled UI**: The application has a simple, visually appealing design created with custom CSS.

## Project Structure

- **Components Folder**: The React components are organized in the `components` folder for better modularity.
  - **TodoList.jsx**: The main file where the todo list logic is implemented. It uses `useState` to manage the tasks and includes the functionality to add, delete, and reorder tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state with `useState`.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and creating a clean, responsive design.

## How It Works

1. Tasks are stored in the state using `useState` hook.
2. Users can add tasks to the list, delete tasks, and move tasks up or down using the corresponding buttons.
3. The list is updated in real-time as users interact with it.
